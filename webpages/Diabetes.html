        <h1 class="text1">Diabetes</h1>
        <p>

            Diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce enough insulin or is unable to use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that regulates the amount of sugar in the blood. When there is not enough insulin or the body is unable to use it effectively, sugar builds up in the blood, leading to high blood sugar levels. This can damage various organs and lead to a number of health complications. There are two types of diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2, which have different causes but both result in high blood sugar levels.</p>
