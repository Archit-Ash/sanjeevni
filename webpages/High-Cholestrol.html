        <p>
            High cholesterol, also known as hypercholesterolemia, is a condition where there is an excessive amount of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced by the liver and found in certain foods. It is necessary for the proper functioning of the body, but when levels are too high, it can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.
