        <h1 class="text1">Migraine</h1>
        <p>
            A migraine is a type of headache characterized by a moderate to severe pain that is often described as a pounding or pulsing sensation. Migraines can also cause other symptoms, such as sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and vomiting. The pain of a migraine is usually on one side of the head, but can affect both sides. Some people also experience an "aura" before a migraine, which can include visual disturbances such as flashes of light or blind spots.</p>
