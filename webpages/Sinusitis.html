        <h1 class="text1">Sinusitis</h1>
        <p>
            Sinusitis is an inflammation or swelling of the tissue lining the sinuses. Sinuses are small, air-filled cavities located inside the skull, which are connected to the nose. Sinusitis can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). Acute sinusitis usually develops after a cold or other upper respiratory tract infection and may last up to four weeks. Chronic sinusitis lasts for at least 12 weeks and can be caused by a variety of factors, including nasal polyps, deviated septum, and allergies. Symptoms of sinusitis include nasal congestion, sinus pressure or pain, thick nasal discharge, and fever. Treatment options include over-the-counter medications, antibiotics, and in some cases, surgery.</p>
