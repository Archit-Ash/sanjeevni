        <p>Although many types of viruses can cause a common cold, rhinoviruses
                                                are the most common cause.
                                    
                                                A cold virus enters your body through your mouth, eyes or nose. The
                                                virus can spread through droplets in the air when someone who is
                                                sick coughs, sneezes or talks.
                                    
                                                It also spreads by hand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold
                                                or by sharing contaminated objects, such as eating utensils, towels,
                                                toys or telephones. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth after such
                                                contact, you're likely to catch a cold.
