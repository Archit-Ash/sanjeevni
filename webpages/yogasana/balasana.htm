        <h1>Balasana
        </h1>
        <img src="balasana.webp">
        <ul>
            <li>Kneel on the floor. Touch your big toes together and sit on your heels, then separate your knees about as wide as your hips. (For more of a massage along the front of the body, keep your knees closer together.)
            </li>
            <li>Exhale and fold forward; lay your torso down between your thighs. Narrow your hip points toward the navel, so that they nestle down onto the inner thighs. Broaden across the back of your pelvis at the sacrum and lengthen your tailbone away from the back. Tuck your chin slightly to lift the base of your skull away from the back of your neck.</li>
            <li>Walk your hands out toward the front of your mat for Extended Childâ€™s pose. Or reach back toward your feet and rest the arms on the floor alongside your torso, palms up, releasing the fronts of your shoulders toward the floor. Allow the weight of the shoulders to pull the shoulder blades wide across your back.</li>
            <li>Balasana is a resting pose. Stay anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes.</li>
            <li>To come up, first lengthen the front torso, and then with an inhalation lift from the tailbone as it presses down and into the pelvis.
            </li>
        </ul>
