            <li>Come onto your hands and knees and bring your hands slightly in front of your shoulders. Spread your fingers wide, press down through your knuckles, and tuck your toes under.
            </li>
            <li>Exhale as you lift your knees off the mat and reach your sit bones toward the ceiling. Keep your knees slightly bent as you lengthen your back.</li>
            <li>Press the back of your thighs toward the wall behind you and stretch your heels toward the mat. Straighten your knees without locking them.</li>
            <li>Press the base of your index fingers into the mat. Lift along your inner arms from your wrists to your shoulders. Firm your shoulder blades against your back, then widen them and draw them toward your tailbone. Relax your neck and keep your head between your upper arms.</li>
            <li>Stay here for 10 or more breaths. As you exhale, bend your knees and lower yourself into Childâ€™s Pose</li>
        </ul>
