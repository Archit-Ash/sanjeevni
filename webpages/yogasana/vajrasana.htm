            <li>Sit with your legs stretched straight in front of you.</li>
            <li>Now, fold both the legs and sit in a kneeling position. Keep the hips on the heels; the toes should point out behind you, and your big toes should touch each other at the back.</li>
            <li>If you are a beginner, you may want to keep a cushion under your feet for comfort to prevent ankle pain.</li>
            <li>You can also choose to keep a cushion or blanket above the feet and below the knees, in case of knee pain. Donâ€™t forget to consult your doctor in case of some special medical conditions.</li>
            <li>Sit comfortably on the pit formed by the parted heels.</li>
            <li>Keep your head, neck, and spine in a straight line. Place your palms on your thighs, facing upwards.</li>
            <li>If you are an advanced yoga practitioner, hold this pose for about 15 minutes, while taking long and deep breaths. Beginners may start with about 30 seconds, according to their comfort level.</li>
            <li>Exhale and relax.</li>
            <li>Straighten your legs.</li>
        </ul>
