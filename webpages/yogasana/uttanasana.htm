        <ul>
            <li>Begin in Tadasana (Mountain Pose) at the front of the mat with your hands at your hips.
            </li>
            <li>Bend your knees slightly and fold your torso over your legs, hingeing from the hips, not the lower back.</li>
            <li>Your hands may land next to your feet or on the ground in front of you.</li>
            <li>Inhale and extend your chest to lengthen your spine.</li>
            <li>Exhale and gently press both legs toward straight without hyperextending. Lift the kneecaps and gently spiral your upper, inner thighs back.</li>
            <li>On an exhalation, extend your torso down without rounding your back. Lengthen your neck, extending the crown of your head toward the ground, while you draw your shoulders down your back toward your hips.</li>
        </ul>
