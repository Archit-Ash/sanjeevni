        <ul>
            <li>Sit on the floor in Dandasana with your legs extended. Bend your right knee out to the side, and cradle your knee and your foot in your hands. Rotate your leg from the hip (not the knee) and guide your foot into your left hip crease.
            </li>
            <li>Bend your left knee, rotating the thigh outward from the hip and, just as you did on the right. Lift your shin slightly and guide the left foot over the right, and bring it to tuck into the right hip crease.
            </li>
            <li>Settle the tops of your feet against your upper thighs and release your knees towards the floor. Try not to let the ankles sickle.</li>
            <li>Sit up tall, lift your sternum and lengthening your spine. Sitting on a folded blanket may help keep the spine from rounding.</li>
            <li>Take slow, deep breaths and stay in the pose as long as is comfortable.</li>
        </ul>
