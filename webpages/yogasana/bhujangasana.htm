        <ul>
            <li>Begin on your belly with your feet hip-distance apart and your hands beside your ribs.
            </li>
            <li>Extend your big toes straight back and press down with all ten toenails to activate your quadriceps.</li>
            <li>Rotate your inner thighs toward the ceiling to broaden the lower back.</li>
            <li>Pressing down lightly with your hands, start to lift your head and chest, rolling your shoulders back and down.</li>
            <li>Keep the back of your neck long and focus on lifting your sternum instead of lifting your chin.</li>
            <li>Straighten your arms while keeping your shoulders remaining away from your ears. Keep at least a slight bend in your elbows.</li>
            <li>To exit the pose, release back to your mat.</li>
